There are several things that might cause an OOM event other than the system
running out of RAM and available swap space due to the workload. 
* The kernel might not be able to utilize swap space optimally due to the type
  of workload on the system. 
* Applications that utilize mlock() or HugePages have memory that can't be
  swapped to disk when the system starts to run low on physical memory.
* Kernel data structures can also take up too much space exhausting memory on
  the system and causing an OOM situation. 
* Many NUMA architectureâ€“based systems can experience OOM conditions because of
  one node running out of memory triggering an OOM in the kernel while plenty
of memory is left in the remaining nodes.
