 @reboot configures a job to run once when the daemon is started. Since cron is
 typically never restarted, this typically corresponds to the machine being
 booted. This behavior is enforced in some variations of cron, such as that
 provided in Debian,^[2] so that simply restarting the daemon does not re-run
 @reboot jobs.  @reboot can be useful if there is a need to start up a server
 or daemon under a particular user, and the user does not have access to
 configure init to start the program.
