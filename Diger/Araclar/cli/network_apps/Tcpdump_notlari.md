Use TCPDUMP to Monitor HTTP Traffic
1. To monitor HTTP traffic including request and response headers and message
body:
```
tcpdump -A -s 0 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) -
((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'
```
2. To monitor HTTP traffic including request and response headers and message
body from a particular source:
```
tcpdump -A -s 0 'src example.com and tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] -
((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) - ((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)'
```
3. To monitor HTTP traffic including request and response headers and message
body from local host to local host:
```
tcpdump -A -s 0 'tcp port 80 and (((ip[2:2] - ((ip[0]&0xf)<<2)) -
((tcp[12]&0xf0)>>2)) != 0)' -i lo
```
4. To only include HTTP requests, modify “tcp port 80” to “tcp dst port 80” in
above commands

5. Capture TCP packets from local host to local host
```
tcpdump -i lo
```
