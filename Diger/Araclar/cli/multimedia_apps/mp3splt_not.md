-f        Frame  mode  (mp3  only).  Process all frames, seeking
          split  positions  by  counting  frames  and  not  with
          bitrate  guessing. In this mode you have higher preci‚Äê
          sion and you can split  variable  bitrate  (VBR)  mp3.
          (You  can  also split costant bitrate mp3, but it will
          take more time). Note also that "high" precision means
          that  time  seeking  is reliable, but may not coincide
          for example with another player program that uses time
          seeking  with  bitrate  guessing, so make your choice.
          Frame mode will print extra  info  on  split  process,
          such  as sync errors.  If you obtain some sync errors,
          try also to split with -e option.
