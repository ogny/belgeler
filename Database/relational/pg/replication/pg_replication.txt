Streaming Replication Demo:
1- su –postgres -> to connect as postgres
2- psql –p 5432 postgres postgres -> to have a cluster at 5432
3- vi /opt/PostgreSQL/9.3/data/postgresql.conf -> to open the config file 
uncomment wal_level, convert it to ‘hot_standby’
uncomment synchronous_commit -> if you want synchronous replication
uncomment archive_mode, convert it to ‘on’
uncomment archive_command, convert it to ’cp %p /home/postgres/arch_dest/%f’
uncomment max_val_senders, convert it to ‘2’
uncomment wal_keep_segments, convert it to ‘32’
save and close
4- vi /opt/PostgreSQL/9.3/data/pg_hba.conf -> to make entry for replication
uncomment default replication entries
if you have an another server where you want to put your standby, add that
manually eg. host replication postgres 192.168.1.20/32 md5
save and close
5- mkdir /home/postgres/arch_dest -> before restarting the server, you should
verify you have arch_dest directory in home directory, or you should add
6- pg_ctl –D /opt/PostgreSQL/9.3/data –mf restart -> to restart the server by
specifying where is the data directory
7- psql -> connects to the default port, which is 5432
8- show wal_level -> it should show “hot_standby”
9- show archive_mode -> it should show “on”
10- to verify archiving works
\q -> quit
ls arch_dest/ -> which should show empty
psql
select pg_switch_xlog(); -> to force a switch, therefore to force a checkpoint
\q
ls arch_dest/ -> which should now show some file
11- to take a backup
psql
select pg_start_backup(‘ForStandbyLabel’)
\q
cp –rp /opt/PostgreSQL/9.3/data /home/postgres/standby -> this will copy base
backup on the standby
psql
select pg_stop_backup(); -> to signal the backup is done
12- to set up standby
\q
ls standby/
rm standby/postmaster.pid
vi standby/recovery.conf
standby_mode=’on’
primary_conninfo=’host=localhost port=5432 user=postgres’
trigger_file=’home/postgres/trg1234’ -> to trigger a failover on slave
vi standby/postgresql.conf
change port to 5433
uncomment hot_standby and convert to ‘on’
comment archive_mode and archive_command
pg_stl –D standby/start -> to start the standby server
psql –p 5433
13- psql –p 5432 -> connect to the master
14- create user edbstore password “edbstore”;
15- create database edbstore owner edbstore;
16- select * from pg_database -> to see the databases in the master
17- /q
18- psql –p 5433
19- select * from pg_database -> to see the new database edbstore is added to
the slave also
a. or, create table emp (id numeric);
b. insert into emp values(1);
c. table emp;
d. psql –p 5433
e. table emp; -> you will see the value ‘1’
20- Let’s say there is a problem with master;
a. pg_ctl –mf stop
b. psql –p 5433
21- You can’t do anything but reading with slave, you need failover
a. İf you are already in postgres directory
b. touch trg1234 -> to invoke a failover
